# TDI-Bankruptcy
The purpose of this project is to describe how graphical deficiencies are addressed, how different type of bankruptcies change over time from 2008 to 2018 at state level, how bankruptcies are related to the performance of S&P 500. Since it is difficult to find graphical representations of bankruptcy data that shows comparison between states and how it is related to the overall economy.

In my project, I used three sources of data, bankruptcy data provided by the Federal Judicial Center, population data from US census and S&P 500 INDEX prices from Yahoo finance (2008-2018). It has more than 250 millions records and over 80 variables.
